# Instant Payment Notification (IPN) is posted by paypal to the notify_url . This IPN guarantees that the payment has been made. Hence it is
# utmost important that someone is not able to make a fake IPN notifcation. To verify IPN paypal provides two different types of validations
#  - Shared secrets for validations
#  - Using Postbacks valiation
#
#  Here we are going to use Postback validation. Here are are the rules for handling Postback validation.
#  - postback must be sent to https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr.
#  - postback must include the variable cmd with the value _notify-validate. cmd=_notify-validate
#  - postback must include exactly the same variables and values that you receive in the IPN from PayPal, and they must be in the same order.
#  - PayPal responds to your postbacks with a single word in the body of the response: VERIFIED or INVALID.  When you receive a VERIFIED
#  postback response then perform further checks.
#  - Check that the payment_status is Completed.
#  - Check that the receiver_email is the merchant email address.
#  - Check that the price carried in mc_gross matches the total price of the order.
